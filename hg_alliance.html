        <hr style="border-top:solid #F7931B 2px">
        <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide the outcome. As one of the world powers battling for supremacy you must lead your country's military drive; but you can't do it alone. You have to form alliances and then betray your allies before they betray you!</p>
        <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the strike. Will it be a bombing raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, move into enemy territory with your forces and win the conflict.</p>
        <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments and develop secret weapons from your country's economic funds and natural reserves, but be sure to save something for the future.</p>

            <h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
            <hr style="border-top:solid #F7931B 2px">
            <p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share similar features including the formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated through random draws of a deck or the roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that is new or innovative in that regard.</p>
            <p>We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. In fact, I dare say we spent more time reading and rereading the rule book than actually playing the game. If you want to read a book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

            <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
            <hr style="border-top:solid #F7931B 2px">
            <p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the game play to be robust and engaging. The rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with experience in this class of board games, there is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We think the battle simulation cards are some of the best we have encountered.</p>
            <p>All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is fierce. There are a lot of established titles with loyal clients. We're not exactly sure where Alliance fits in with that group. It's a good game, but not good enough to draw our attention away from games like Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

            <h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
            <hr style="border-top:solid #F7931B 2px">
            <p>Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>
            <p>Things We Liked:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
                <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
                <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
                <li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Things We Hated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
                <li>Setup takes too long</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored.</p>
